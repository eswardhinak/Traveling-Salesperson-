W, H, N are stated in the main.cpp file. They specify the number range that x and y can take respectively. N is the number of points (number of vertices). Every vertex has an edge to every other vertex. 

The adjacency matrix that is created contains the edge length between each vertex to every other vertex. It is rounded. The method that gets the Euclidean distance rounds the doubles to integers.

MST and TSP2 work well. Need to figure out DFS for eulerian tour of edges.

What TO fix

current implementation doesn't allow duplicates of edges that are given because of minimum matching. This is because of unordered map implementatin
must change that implementation to vector based so that we can have duplicates of edges. a yeeeeeeeeee
